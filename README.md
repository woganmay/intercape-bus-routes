Intercape Bus Routes
====================

A map of all the towns serviced by the Intercape bus company (operating from South Africa).

I pulled this together from the bus stop listing at: http://www.intercape.co.za/bookings/stopinfo/index.phtml

It's not completely valid. 8 of the stops didn't come up with any search results, and a few of them were duplicates, eg: *Windhoek* and *Windhoek Depot*. In those cases only the town was added.
